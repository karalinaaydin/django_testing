# Ya News and Ya Notes Project - Test Suite

This project focuses on adding comprehensive test coverage for two existing Django applications: Ya News and Ya Notes. The tests were written using both pytest and unittest frameworks to ensure the robustness of the apps by testing the core logic, routes, and content.

Features:
.Test Coverage for Core Logic: Tests the internal logic of both Ya News and Ya Notes applications to ensure correctness and reliability.
.Route Testing: Verifies that all defined routes in the Django applications function correctly, returning the expected responses.
.Content Validation: Ensures that the apps display the correct content based on various inputs and conditions.

Technologies Used:
.Django: The web framework used for the Ya News and Ya Notes applications.
.pytest: A powerful testing framework used for writing flexible, easy-to-read tests.
.unittest: The built-in Python testing framework used to complement the pytest tests and ensure broad test coverage.
